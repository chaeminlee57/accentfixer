# accentfixer

This project is dedicated to my mother, myself, and other immigrants struggling to sound closer to the native American language. By utilizing AI, the project aims to point out discrepancies between the user's recorded accent and native American English. 

At launch, the project will support General American accent. I plan to add a British accent option later for those living in the U.K.
